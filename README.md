# Callback? Phonebook

Jim, here is your phonebook. It saves your contacts in a MySQL database, but luckily you just need to interact with the user interface created from Python's Tkinter. All the functions you need are there, including:
* Entering contacts (Including their first name, last name, phone number, and birthday)
* Retrieving contacts
* Editing contacts
* Searching contacts
* Deleting contacts

Are you ready to try it? 

You'll need some tools before you can run the code:
1. [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
2. [Latest version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) of Python
3. [PyMySQL](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/)
